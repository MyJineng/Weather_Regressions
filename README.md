Using APIs to grab weather data, regression's were run on various aspects of the climate, such as temp, humidity, cloudiness, etc.. to determine if there was a relationship between latitude. Only temp had a strong relationship while the rest had an r-value of 2 or lower. Aditionally the names of hotels between a certain temp were retreived and displayed on a map.
